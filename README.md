## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

npm installed

node installed

Then, just npm install in the root directory.

```
npm install
```


### Running

After you have bundle installed, you can now run the server with this:

```
npm start
```

Then, you can navigate to localhost:8000 and create a game to play. Please note that this is a multiplayer game with no single player mode so multiple players will need to join the game to start.
